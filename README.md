I applied my skills in Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and clustering segmentation to uncover insights from consumer data. The objective was to understand the demographic factors, purchase behaviors, and campaign success rates among different customer segments.

After performing a comprehensive EDA and clustering analysis, I visualized the findings using Looker Studio, creating an interactive dashboard. This dashboard highlights key insights, including:

Demographic breakdowns of consumer education and age.

Analysis of consumer purchasing patterns across different channels (store, web, and catalog).

Assessment of campaign effectiveness across different customer segments.

Visual representation of cluster-based customer segmentation.
